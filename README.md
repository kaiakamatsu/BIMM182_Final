# BIMM182_Final
ecDNA and DepMap Analysis

## Data 

DepMap CRISPR Selectivity Scores: https://depmap.org/portal/download/all/

# Analysis Planned 

1. Make sure we are using the correct CRISPR gene dependency file
2. Plot the distribution of gene dependency values across cell lines (normal with many values around mean? -> summarize with average across cell lines)
3. Subset to ecDNA genes, create 5 sets of random non-ecDNA genes
4. 



Ask TA 
- Interpretation of cell line "classification" correctly: does this mean each cell line either contains or does not contain ecDNA? Are the genes listed the genes that are present in the ecDNA or just in the cell line in general?
